The Protein Data Bank is an important resource for scientists. It stores the sequences of amino acids that make up proteins, one of the building blocks of life. The databases stores protein sequences as strings of letters, like this:

6LQA
Each of those letters represents a tiny piece of a living thing. Most sequences seem like kind of a jumble when viewed this way but every once in a while, just by chance, you can find a sequence that looks like this:


4UXL
There’s a readable English word in there! In this case, it’s the name of a hit collaboration between Taylor Swift and Ice Spice.

You won’t find every letter in these sequences. Only twenty of the twenty-six letters in the English alphabet are used. For this reason, some words just won’t be in the there. There’s no B for example, so no chance of finding “Betty.”

Lots of words and acronyms are possible with just the available letters though, so I asked myself the obvious question: Are there any Eras Tour bracelet ideas in the database?
